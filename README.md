## Support & Security

Support for this extension must be posted to the main [Phpfastcache repository](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/issues).

## Composer installation:

```php
composer install phpfastcache/couchbasev4-extension
```

#### ⚠️ This extension requires:

1️⃣ The PHP `Couchbase` extension 4.x at least

2️⃣ The composer `Couchbase/Couchbase` library 4.x at least

#### ⚠️ This extension optionally requires: 
1️⃣ The PHP `Posix` to fix a known Couchbase Extension bug [PCBC-886](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/PCBC/issues/PCBC-886).  
Once this bug has been fixed the dependency suggestion will be removed. 
If your application wants to fork the processes using `pcntl_fork()` the `Posix` extension is needed, and you want the fix to be enabled, set up the config like this:
```php
$config = (new CouchbaseConfig())->doForkDetection(true);
```

2️⃣ Also the PHP `Pcntl` if you plan to contribute to this project and run the tests before pushing your Merge Request.
